"""cabt integer enums — mirrored verbatim from the official `cg.api` (cg-lib).

These are the AUTHORITATIVE values (source: data/engine/cg/api.py). We hardcode
them here so the agent has zero dependency on the (Linux-only) engine at import
time — the agent runs anywhere, and on the ladder these match `cg.api` exactly.

Earlier these were guessed from a single game; several were WRONG (notably the
AreaType mapping). Now calibrated. If the competition appends new enum members,
update here.
